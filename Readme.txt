This script can vote up or down for comments at Trashbox.ru. Instruction for using is in file voter.py, just check it and run.

Some time ago it was able to automatically register accounts with captcha recognising (example of previous captcha is in captcha.gif file).

But this ability has been broken by site admin who changed captcha to Google ReCaptcha.

So you still can register account manually and vote from them with this script.

File regger.py is here just for history.
